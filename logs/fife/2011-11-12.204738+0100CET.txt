(08:48:13 PM) karottenreibe: having a litte trouble using the imagemanager, could you help me out?
(08:48:33 PM) vtchill: sure whats up
(08:48:35 PM) karottenreibe: nomatter what i do, i always get RuntimeError: _[NotFound]_ , Something was searched, but not found :: content/gui/images/cursors/cursor.png
(08:48:45 PM) karottenreibe: I tried absolute paths as well, same thing
(08:49:04 PM) vtchill: how did you load the image?
(08:49:13 PM) karottenreibe: imagemanager.load('/media/data/proj/unknown-horizons/content/gui/images/cursors/cursor.png')
(08:50:20 PM) karottenreibe: the imagemanager I got from engine.getImageManager() and the engine is the one I get from fifedit
(08:50:35 PM) vtchill: ok
(08:50:46 PM) karottenreibe: could it be that it expects relative paths?
(08:51:50 PM) karottenreibe: hm jep. looks like it^^
(08:51:59 PM) karottenreibe: if i append a lot of ../.. it works ;-)
(08:52:03 PM) karottenreibe: is that intended behaviour?
(08:52:27 PM) GreyGhost_: karottenreibe, giving content/gui/images/cursors/cursor.png did not work?
(08:52:36 PM) vtchill: it uses the vfs to load and the vfs has "paths" that it looks in when loading
(08:52:49 PM) karottenreibe: GreyGhost_: my PWD is not the UH dir, it's fife/trunk/tools/editor
(08:53:04 PM) vtchill: so the vfs will go through its search paths... by default only the root dir (where the application was started from is in the search path)
(08:53:16 PM) karottenreibe: hm ok makes sense
(08:53:40 PM) vtchill: you can add a path to the vfs to search if you want and it should work
(08:53:52 PM) GreyGhost_: i think it has some addNewPath or something ..
(08:54:01 PM) GreyGhost_: addNewSource()

(08:54:08 PM) GreyGhost_: sweet updated epydoc :D
(08:54:48 PM) karottenreibe: ok nice, I'll try that, thanks :-)
(08:54:48 PM) vtchill: in the fife map loader i always load things by adding the map file directory (which is absolute from where the application was loaded)
(08:54:58 PM) vtchill: so it is in affect absolute from application dir
(08:56:09 PM) vtchill: so if you ever look at the path from loading an object.xml from the fife loader it may look really weird like.... ../../<demo_name>/maps/../objects/<object_name>/object.xml
(08:57:36 PM) qubodup [~qubodup@46.115.25.62] entered the room.
(08:57:45 PM) karottenreibe: hehe ok
(08:58:53 PM) Beliar: vtchill, follow works as you told (calling OnInstanceActionFinished when it reached the "leader")
(08:59:01 PM) karottenreibe: awesome! it worked, thanks vtchill and GreyGhost_
(08:59:08 PM) vtchill: np
(08:59:11 PM) vtchill: ok great to hear Beliar 
(09:00:10 PM) Beliar: looks much better than our method (that checked the distance from the agent after it moved to its orignal location)
(09:00:23 PM) vtchill: yea definitely
