(09:44:43 PM) prock: hi karottenreibe 
(09:44:50 PM) karottenreibe: nihathrael said you needed something
(09:45:08 PM) prock: the ticket you posted about the editor paths
(09:45:13 PM) prock: the filebrowser
(09:45:15 PM) karottenreibe: ah right
(09:45:22 PM) prock: the patch you posted doesn't work for me
(09:45:40 PM) prock: but it kindof points out that the filebroswer is a bit more broken than I thought
(09:46:03 PM) karottenreibe: really? hm. it fixed the problems for me, but then again i didn't do a very thorough check^^ just the stuff that was broken for me
(09:46:40 PM) prock: right.. it seems that if you run the FIFE editor from the editor's directory it wont allow you to browse bast th eeditor's root directory
(09:46:51 PM) karottenreibe: oh not very good
(09:47:20 PM) karottenreibe: yeah it's kinda weird that the editor takes the VFS root directories as its basis for the file browser and mixes them all together
(09:47:27 PM) prock: I'm going to look into it a bit more..  but if you have a chance to play around with it some more andd find something out feel free to post it in the ticket
(09:47:33 PM) prock: I have to run for a few mins...  bbiab
(09:47:35 PM) prock is now known as prock|afk
(09:47:41 PM) karottenreibe: alright
(09:47:54 PM) karottenreibe: well, I think the VFS stuff is a bit broken from what i remember so far
(09:48:24 PM) karottenreibe: I won't have any time soon, uni is pretty stressful right now. maybe in a week or something
(09:49:35 PM) karottenreibe: one thing you could try is adding "/" as a root directory to VFS, but I don't know how that will fare on windows ;-)
(09:50:06 PM) karottenreibe: anyways, I'm pretty shagged out, I'm gonna hit the telly. if you need anything more, I'll stick around in the channel a bit longer ;-)
(10:12:37 PM) prock|afk: back
(10:12:40 PM) prock|afk is now known as prock
(10:12:47 PM) prock: karottenreibe: no worries.. I'll dig more into it
(10:13:20 PM) prock: thanks for the info and making the ticket to bring it to our attention
(11:24:42 PM) karottenreibe: no problem, I'm off for tonight
