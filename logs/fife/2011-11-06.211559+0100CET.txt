(09:19:00 PM) prock: hi fife
(09:19:29 PM) karottenreibe: hi prock
(09:19:33 PM) karottenreibe: just the guy i need ;-)
(09:19:43 PM) karottenreibe: nihathrael told me to talk to you, do you have a minute?
(09:19:45 PM) prock: hi karottenreibe 
(09:19:49 PM) prock: sure do.. whats up?
(09:20:10 PM) karottenreibe: it's about this patch here: http://fife.trac.cvsdude.com/engine/ticket/598
(09:20:20 PM) karottenreibe: he said you're the guy to talk to about getting it merged
(09:20:28 PM) karottenreibe: it's a fix for the editor we need at UH
(09:20:50 PM) karottenreibe: could you have a look and tell me if it's OK this way or if I need to work on something before you can merge it?
(09:21:12 PM) karottenreibe: it just adds a command line option --plugin-dir so we can set a different plugin dir
(09:21:26 PM) prock: right.. for setting an additional plugin directory
(09:21:30 PM) karottenreibe: exactly
(09:22:03 PM) karottenreibe: we're working on adapting fifedit for the UH maps so it would be awesome if we could get this merged :D
(09:22:24 PM) prock: I had looked over your first patch.. looks good to me.  perhaps it could also be something a user could set in their settings.xml file for the editor as well
(09:22:52 PM) karottenreibe: yeah, sure. I don't know much about that though^^
(09:23:09 PM) prock: your patch looks complete enough for me to apply it though
(09:23:19 PM) karottenreibe: great!
