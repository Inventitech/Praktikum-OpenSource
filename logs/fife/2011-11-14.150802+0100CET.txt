(04:22:10 PM) prock: morning vtchill
(04:22:14 PM) vtchill: hey prock 
(04:22:25 PM) karottenreibe: thx prock :D
(04:22:42 PM) prock: np
(04:23:16 PM) vtchill: yea i saw 604, it was intended to be written that way  until we actually supported multiple loaders properly
(04:26:09 PM) karottenreibe: ah ok, well, I hope the way it is now is OK. otherwise our custom loader wouldn't be used at all
(04:27:18 PM) vtchill: yea its fine to change it, i just wanted to force the use of the default loader until we got the proper support in the editor to allow the user to choose a loader and got rid of the loaders.py
(04:27:43 PM) karottenreibe: alright, good :-)
(04:27:46 PM) vtchill: but since you are working with loaders.py it will have to be changed for you to continue
(04:28:29 PM) karottenreibe: great, i gotta run now
(04:28:31 PM) karottenreibe: cya
