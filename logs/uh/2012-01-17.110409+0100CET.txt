(11:04:14 AM) karottenreibe: morning
(11:04:50 AM) totycro_: hi karottenreibe 
(11:05:06 AM) totycro_: could you perhaps give an update at one of the next meetings?
(11:05:20 AM) karottenreibe: sure
(11:05:29 AM) karottenreibe: we're porting to the new component architecture right now
(11:05:50 AM) karottenreibe: BTW has anyone ever gotten an error 22 when trying to use the YamlCache?
(11:06:00 AM) karottenreibe: it seems that the dbm can't open the cache db for some reason
(11:06:04 AM) totycro_: keyerror 22?
(11:06:13 AM) karottenreibe: no, error 22 invalid argument
(11:06:16 AM) totycro_: place save and post the traceback when you get that
(11:06:44 AM) karottenreibe: found this: http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2010-February/1236404.html
(11:06:48 AM) karottenreibe: seems to be OS dependant
(11:07:15 AM) karottenreibe: I can't give you a save, it's from the editor code, but i'll give you a traceback, mom
(11:07:53 AM) karottenreibe: http://pastie.org/3200313
(11:08:49 AM) karottenreibe: and this is what i get when i start UH and click on singleplayer: http://pastie.org/3200319
(11:08:55 AM) karottenreibe: OS is ArchLinux
(11:11:29 AM) totycro_: so the error really is in the shelve code
(11:11:51 AM) karottenreibe: seems like it. no idea why though
(11:12:47 AM) karottenreibe: what kind of DB is that anyways?
(11:12:49 AM) CIA-29: unknown-horizons: Moritz Beller editor * r63e7dcd / editor/plugins/UHMapSaver.py : fixes saver plugin - http://git.io/azYRmA
(11:13:21 AM) totycro_: we only use a high level interface, that should be guaranteed to have something nice below

(11:13:40 AM) Meldrian [~Michael@p578b6cd0.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] entered the room.
(11:14:12 AM) totycro_: so i don't know what to do, could you either open a ticket or fix the error?
(11:18:32 AM) karottenreibe: I'll google for a bit
(11:18:56 AM) wentam [~wentam@76-236-8-125.lightspeed.gdrpmi.sbcglobal.net] entered the room.
(11:19:55 AM) karottenreibe: hm, maybe i'm missing a package? what dbm packages do you have installed?
(11:20:21 AM) karottenreibe: it seems the underlying implementation is anydbm, so it should be either bsddb, gdbm, dbm or dumbdbm
(11:21:52 AM) totycro_: well i seem to have gdbm
(11:22:20 AM) karottenreibe: hm, ok
(11:22:31 AM) karottenreibe: i deleted the cache file and now it runs fine...
(11:22:48 AM) totycro_: we once had this issues:
(11:22:50 AM) totycro_:       # Some python distributions used to use the bsddb module as underlying shelve.
(11:22:53 AM) totycro_:       # The bsddb module is now deprecated since 2.6 and is not present in some 2.7 distributions.
(11:22:56 AM) totycro_:       # Therefore, the line above will yield an ImportError if it has been executed with
(11:22:59 AM) totycro_:       # a python supporting bsddb and now is executed again with python with no support for it.
(11:23:02 AM) totycro_:       # Since this may also be caused by a different error, we just try again once.
(11:23:06 AM) totycro_: could it also be some 2.6/2.7 versioning thing for you?
(11:23:13 AM) karottenreibe: possible
(11:23:32 AM) karottenreibe: so, I'll just ignore that?
(11:23:48 AM) totycro_: we could catch the error and delete the cache
(11:23:56 AM) Kris_CZ [~Kris_CZ@nezmar.jabbim.cz] entered the room.
(11:24:44 AM) totycro_: do you want to do it or should i?

(11:26:05 AM) karottenreibe: doesn't say the class name
(11:26:16 AM) tuempl [~Miranda@e208-030.eduroam.tuwien.ac.at] entered the room.
(11:26:26 AM) totycro_: class error(Exception): pass
(11:26:31 AM) totycro_: that's from anydbm.py
(11:26:42 AM) karottenreibe: ah ok
(11:26:54 AM) totycro_: an odd construction
(11:27:05 AM) hagabaka left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 240 seconds).
(11:27:17 AM) karottenreibe: so I have to import anydbm and then except anydbm.error?
(11:28:16 AM) totycro_: you could also catch all exceptions
(11:28:46 AM) totycro_: if removing the cache fixes the error, then fine, and if not, the error will be reproduced, also fine
(11:29:32 AM) karottenreibe: great
(11:32:58 AM) karottenreibe: yup, seems to work

(11:51:16 AM) totycro_: karottenreibe: i guess generally, for user acceptance, it would be very beneficial if as many people as possible test the editor before the merge
(11:51:37 AM) totycro_: so that probably has to be an effort on both your side as devs and of users
(11:54:39 AM) scaabi [~scaabi@p5483B025.dip.t-dialin.net] entered the room.
(11:58:57 AM) karottenreibe: who would be users?
(11:59:13 AM) karottenreibe: in terms of specific people
(11:59:34 AM) totycro_: for the editor, i guess primarily the uh team
(12:06:44 PM) totycro_: i'm just saying that people like a software better if they are somehow involved in the dev process, even if they don't actually change sth

(12:15:49 PM) karottenreibe: totycro_: yeah, that's probably so. as long as people keep in mind that the current state is still, let's call it, "raw" ;-)
(12:16:17 PM) totycro_: k :)
(12:16:18 PM) karottenreibe: how would we arrange for that? just tell people to check it out during the next meeting and then give feedback directly to us?
(12:16:55 PM) totycro_: well, seeing that we mostly communicate here, it should also be directed here
(12:17:03 PM) totycro_: but it can be very informal
(12:17:30 PM) totycro_: as in "hey, i just implemented that, wanna check it out?"
(12:17:38 PM) karottenreibe: alright
(12:18:09 PM) totycro_: your benefit is that everything that no one complains about you can safely release
(12:18:17 PM) karottenreibe: then we'll work on fixing the bugs from the component change an then we'll let you guys know
(12:18:22 PM) karottenreibe: indeed :D
(12:19:39 PM) totycro_: i don't know how much time you have to hang around here, but it usually happens that feedback just appears at any unforseeable point
(12:19:54 PM) totycro_: you could also try to do that via forum if you like
(12:21:00 PM) karottenreibe: hehe
(12:21:14 PM) karottenreibe: I'll keep that in mind
(12:21:17 PM) karottenreibe: thx
