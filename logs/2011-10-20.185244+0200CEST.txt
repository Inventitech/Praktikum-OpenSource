(06:52:55 PM) karottenreibe: cheers
(06:56:58 PM) karottenreibe: so, I'm one of the two guys who would be interested in building a mapeditor. my friend told me that would be something the project needs
(06:57:36 PM) karottenreibe: is there anyone who can give me some insight into what that existing editor actually does (cause I can't seem to get it to do anything at all^^) or point me to some resources about the savegame format?
(07:02:06 PM) gscai: karottenreibe: afaik the current editor doesn't do anything useful
(07:02:50 PM) karottenreibe: gscai: alright, so it's starting from scratch basically^^
(07:02:59 PM) gscai: you can browse saved game using your favourite sqlite manager
(07:03:13 PM) karottenreibe: ah nice, I'll have a look at this
(07:03:34 PM) inken [~inken@a89-182-41-130.net-htp.de] entered the room.
(07:04:03 PM) gscai: the actual maps are also stored as sqlite files in content/islands and content/maps
(07:04:17 PM) karottenreibe: nice, thanks
(07:05:46 PM) gscai: there is a slight difference between the way the master branch and the development branch store info about tiles
(07:06:14 PM) karottenreibe: so I should probably use the development branch I guess?
(07:06:29 PM) gscai: I would say so
(07:06:50 PM) gscai: nihathrael knows more about the differences between the systems
(07:07:01 PM) karottenreibe: great, I'll ask him then
(07:09:12 PM) spq: iirc, he is currently at google hq or something
(07:09:30 PM) karottenreibe: hehe yeah could be, he said something like that^^
(07:09:33 PM) janebot: Don't forget about the meeting Sunday at 17:00 UTC! For reference, it is currently 17:00 UTC on Thursday. [ http://wiki.unknown-horizons.org/w/Next_meeting[1] ]
(07:09:45 PM) karottenreibe: ah thanks!
(07:11:34 PM) karottenreibe: ah, I won't make that unfortunately, but I'll definitely be there at the next meeting
(07:11:49 PM) spq: that was a bot ;)
(07:12:03 PM) gscai: janebot: are you a bot?
(07:12:05 PM) janebot: gscai: Maybe I am, maybe I'm not. 
(07:12:12 PM) karottenreibe: heh, sry, didn't look at the username xD
(07:12:19 PM) spq: :)
(07:12:21 PM) totycro_: karottenreibe: the engine already provides some kind of framework for an editor
(07:12:37 PM) karottenreibe: totycro_: is that what has been used in the existing editor?
(07:12:41 PM) totycro_: afaik, we mostly have to provide loaders for our game-data and savers for the map file format
(07:12:56 PM) karottenreibe: that would be nice of course
(07:12:57 PM) totycro_: yes, but the engine changed a lot there, so we can't reuse the old code
(07:13:10 PM) totycro_: you will probably have to talk to nihathrael about the details
(07:13:14 PM) karottenreibe: alright, maybe I can dig up some documentation on that from the fife site
(07:13:27 PM) totycro_: they also have a channel here: #fife
(07:13:34 PM) spq: does uh use "idland templates" or contains a map the whole tile information?
(07:13:42 PM) spq: island
(07:13:46 PM) totycro_: a map only contains references to islands
(07:13:51 PM) totycro_: iirc
(07:14:08 PM) spq: ok, so one has to provide two editors - or one which can handle both
(07:14:24 PM) karottenreibe: yeah, I saw that in the sqlite files
(07:14:43 PM) totycro_: karottenreibe: feel free to ask anything you might want to know
(07:15:01 PM) totycro_: it would be really great if you could have a look at the editor, that's one of the most important missing features imo
(07:15:11 PM) karottenreibe: great, I will
(07:15:37 PM) karottenreibe: right now I'm trying to get a feel for what the old code can do and what actually has to be done with what technology
(07:15:44 PM) karottenreibe: I think it might be an interesting project
(07:18:23 PM) totycro_: the water is not saved in the .sqlite files btw, it's autogenerated by the game
(07:19:01 PM) karottenreibe: ah ok, good to know^^
(07:19:07 PM) totycro_: the islands are loaded in horizons/world/island.py
(07:19:26 PM) totycro_: (i'm just trying to give you some info that you are going to need anyway, so you don't have to find out everything by yourself :)
(07:19:45 PM) totycro_: loading a whole map is in horizons/world/__init__.py
(07:20:19 PM) karottenreibe: awesome, much appreciated :-)
(07:20:52 PM) totycro_: we also have a lot of documentation in the wiki, but most of it is kind of not really up to date
(07:21:35 PM) karottenreibe: hehe, well it's documentation, I would have been very surprised if it was up-to-date xD
(07:22:46 PM) totycro_: i just checked, we have nothing on the map format there, so that solves the problem of outdated info :)

(07:54:20 PM) Kilian]: hi UH-Guest_9
(07:54:51 PM) UH-Guest_9: i would be interessted in beta testing the new upcoming release
(07:56:04 PM) Kilian]: do you use win or linux ?
(07:56:10 PM) UH-Guest_9: linux
(07:56:15 PM) Beliar|AFK is now known as Beliar

(07:56:35 PM) UH-Guest_9: sorry brb?
(07:56:59 PM) Kilian]: be right back ^^
(07:57:06 PM) UH-Guest_9: ah ok thx
(07:57:31 PM) UH-Guest_9: do i have to compile it myself or are there precompiled binaries for fedora
(07:57:33 PM) Kilian]: there arent any packages for fedora yet cause of some trouble with dependencies
(07:57:45 PM) UH-Guest_9: ok
(07:57:46 PM) Kilian]: there arent, you ahve to compile by yourself
(07:57:59 PM) UH-Guest_9: i had some problems with the current stable release
(07:58:38 PM) Kilian]: which ones ?
(07:58:51 PM) UH-Guest_9: with the sdl lib for example
(07:59:00 PM) UH-Guest_9: only a naming problem
(07:59:27 PM) UH-Guest_9: libSDL* instead of libsdl* or something like that
(08:00:34 PM) UH-Guest_9: it was in conflict with a locally installed one from fedora itself (main repo)
(08:00:48 PM) Kilian]: hm, okay
(08:01:10 PM) Kilian]: the packages we had are broken now, i will update the hint at the website in some minutes
(08:01:23 PM) karottenreibe: totycro_: thanks for the help, I think I have enough stuff to look into now and see how it all fits together :-) cheers!
(08:01:24 PM) UH-Guest_9: ok
